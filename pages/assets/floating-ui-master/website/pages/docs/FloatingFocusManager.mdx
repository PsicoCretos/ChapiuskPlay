# FloatingFocusManager

Provides flexible focus management for a floating element.

This component should only be rendered when the floating element
is open and directly wrap it.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js /context/
import {
  FloatingFocusManager
} from '@floating-ui/react-dom-interactions';

function App() {
  const {context} = useFloating();

  return (
    <>
      {/* reference element */}
      {open && (
        <FloatingFocusManager context={context}>
          {/* floating element */}
        </FloatingFocusManager>
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

## Props

```js
interface Props {
  context: FloatingContext;
  order?: Array<'reference' | 'floating' | 'content'>;
  initialFocus?:
    | number
    | React.MutableRefObject<HTMLElement | null>;
  returnFocus?: boolean;
  endGuard?: boolean;
  modal?: boolean;
}
```

### context

**Required**

The `context{:.const}` object returned from `useFloating(){:js}`.

```js
<FloatingFocusManager context={context}>
  {/* floating element */}
</FloatingFocusManager>
```

### order

default: `['content']{:js}`

The order in which focus cycles.

```js
<FloatingFocusManager
  context={context}
  // Initially focuses the floating element. Subsequent tabs
  // will cycle through the tabbable contents of the floating
  // element.
  order={['floating', 'content']}
  // Keeps focus on the reference element. Subsequent tabs
  // will cycle through the tabbable contents of the floating
  // element.
  order={['reference', 'content']}
>
  {/* floating element */}
</FloatingFocusManager>
```

### initialFocus

default: `0{:js}`

Which element to initially focus. Can be either a number
(tabbable index as specified by the `order{:.objectKey}`) or a
ref.

```js
<FloatingFocusManager
  context={context}
  initialFocus={elementRef}
>
  {/* floating element */}
</FloatingFocusManager>
```

### returnFocus

default: `true{:js}`

Determines if focus should be returned to the element that was
focused prior to opening the floating element (usually the
reference element).

```js
<FloatingFocusManager context={context} returnFocus={false}>
  {/* floating element */}
</FloatingFocusManager>
```

### endGuard

default: `true{:js}`

Determines if the end focus guard (after the floating element) is
rendered. If not, focus can escape into the address bar, like in
native dialogs. This means the floating element must be portalled
to the very end of the document.

```js
<FloatingFocusManager context={context} endGuard={false}>
  {/* floating element */}
</FloatingFocusManager>
```

### modal

default: `true{:js}`

Determines if focus is "modal", meaning focus is fully trapped
inside the floating element and outside content cannot be
accessed. This includes screen reader virtual cursors.

```js
<FloatingFocusManager context={context} modal={false}>
  {/* floating element */}
</FloatingFocusManager>
```

#### Non-modal behavior

The floating element must be rendered directly after its
reference element (e.g. not in a FloatingPortal) when non-modal.

#### Modal behavior

Ensure you have an explicit "close" button. This can be either
visible to all users, or visually-hidden so it is only available
to assistive tech.

Touch-based screen readers often will not have an `esc` key
available to dismiss the element, so an explicit close button is
required.

You may use the reference element as the close button with some
components, so the user can navigate to it and use it as a toggle
to both close and open the floating element. This can be achieved
with the `order{:.keyword}` prop and adding the reference as a
string.

#### Comboboxes

The listbox part of a combobox should be rendered directly after
the input reference element when possible.

If the listbox is portaled, detection is added so that DOM focus
does not become modal in this case, but screen reader virtual
cursors do become modal. This ensures a touch user can swipe
right (e.g. iOS screen reader) to navigate the listbox options
immediately.

As with all modal-based focus management, the listbox should have
a visually-hidden dismiss button to ensure touch-based screen
reader users can escape the list due to a lack of an `esc` key.
